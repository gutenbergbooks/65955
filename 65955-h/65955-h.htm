</div>


<p class="cap">In selecting a home site, there are a number of very
important things to be considered. When once you
settle the point of convenient accessibility to your work
or place of business, you doubtless think first of the
neighborhood in which you and your family are going
to live, the kind of people about you, the church,
school, and library privileges, and such like questions.</p>

<p>Then you will consider the physical character of the
place, its slopes and levels, its trees, its gardens, its
outlook, or, in a word, its attractiveness from an
aesthetic point of view; to which are closely related the
practical questions of pure water supply, good drainage,
and shelter from the extremes of weather. No matter
how attractive otherwise a locality might be, you
would not consider it for a moment unless the conditions
of sanitation and healthfulness were fully met; and you
would want some natural protection from the severe
storms of winter as well as from the blazing heat of
summer. In the winter you would want as little breeze
and as much sun, and in the summer as little sun and as
much breeze as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, in selecting your site, it would be well to have
in mind the house you intend to build and the way you
want it to face. If possible, get your house plan first
and select your lot accordingly. Or, at any rate, picture
it all out in your mind to guide you in selecting your
location. By a little planning and forethought you may
not only secure the outlook you want but the exposures
to sun or breeze most desired. You cannot change<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
climatic conditions or topography, but, to an appreciable
extent, you can adjust the location of your house
to them.</p>

<p>The Orientation Chart, here given, shows the points of
sunrise and sunset, on the horizon, midsummer and
midwinter, as well as the direction of the sunlight each
successive hour of the midsummer and midwinter day.
The chart will thus aid you, so far as conditions permit,
in facing your house so as to get the sun or shade
where you want it.</p>

<p>In the first place, you see three broad, concentric circles,
on the outside of which the rising and setting sun is
depicted for both midsummer
and midwinter
day. The figures, 30°–50°,
alongside of the
sun represent degrees
of north latitude, wherever
you may happen
to live, which, with
the exception of most
of Florida and southern
Texas, cover the
United States.
The short arrows
show the direction
of the sun’s rays at
sunrise and sunset.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The inner circle
represents your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
horizon, and the degrees marked upon it show the points
of sunrise and sunset, north or south of the direct east
and west line. These angular distances, in terms of
degrees, are called amplitudes, north or south, and
must not be confused with the degrees of latitude on
the earth’s surface, indicated by the numbers along
side of the sun, though intimately dependent upon
them. The amplitude of the horizon point, where the
sun rises and sets from time to time during the year,
always depends upon the latitude on the earth’s surface
where you happen to live, as may be seen by
following with your eye the direction of the arrows of
latitude through the amplitude circle. Starting from
the number indicating the latitude where you live, trace
the arrow until it touches the amplitude circle. You
can then read the degree on it which shows how far
north or south of the east and west line the sun rises or
sets. We are indebted to Professor Philip Fox, of the
Dearborn Astronomical Observatory at Evanston,
Illinois, for determining these points.</p>

<p>The two outer circles are sun-dials for midsummer and
midwinter day at the 40th degree of north latitude; and,
if you imagined them pivoted on their rising and setting
points and tipped up from the south to represent the
slanting path of the sun during the day, they show the
direction from which the sun is shining during successive
hours of the day (or night on the other side of the
world). The shaded portions of these circles represent
night, which for all northern latitudes is short in summer
and long in winter, as the day is short in winter
and long in summer. If you examine the hour spaces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
on the winter dial of your winter night, you will find
them exactly like those on the summer dial of your summer
day. So also your winter day hours are spaced like
your summer night hours. South of the equator, people
have precisely the same experiences only in the reverse
order. New Zealanders, we fancy, wear straw hats in
January and fur caps in July. If you liked summer well
enough and cared to move, you could live in a perpetual
summer on our little globe. It is probable, however,
that, like most people, you rather prefer the change of
seasons, in spite of occasional extremes.</p>

<p>The irregular hour spaces on the dials would make it
appear that the sun moves around the earth in a sort
of jerky way. On the contrary, it moves, or rather the
earth rotates, at an absolutely uniform rate, but the tilt
of the sun’s path to your horizon line gives you at certain
points a fore-shortened view by which the sun
seems to cover various distances at various stages of
its course.</p>

<p>The sun-dial time is used on our chart as it more
universally applies at different meridians on a given
latitude, than does our standard time which, for the
sake of timepiece uniformity, is a compromise based on
mean solar time. As the earth’s orbit is such as to
make the sun gain a little or lose a little in crossing the
meridian each day during the year, the total <em>annual</em>
time of the sun is averaged into uniform <em>daily</em> periods,
which in turn are divided into 24 uniform hours and
referred to certain meridians the world round, about
an hour apart. To show the exact position of the sun
in strict agreement with these standardized hours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
would require a special chart for every degree of longitude,
and then be of no especial value for our present
purpose; for while the astronomer must have exact time
to the fraction of a second, the differences between
watch and sun-dial are not enough at any time to
affect essentially our problem. So that, if you do not
find the hours marked on our summer and winter sun-dials,
at any time, exactly agreeing with your watch,
you may, nevertheless, trust them to show you accurately
enough from what direction the sun is shining
at different hours of the day.</p>

<p>The chart is drawn for midsummer and midwinter day
on the 40th degree of north latitude, which is taken as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the best average line that runs midway of the country
from ocean to ocean, passing through or near New
York City (N); Philadelphia, Pa; Columbus and
Cincinnati (S), Ohio; Indianapolis, Ind. (S); Springfield,
Ill. (S); St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo. (S); the
northern boundary of Kansas; Denver, Colo. (S); Salt
Lake City, Utah (N); Carson City, Nev. (S); and
Sacramento, Calif. (S). With the exception of St. Louis
and Sacramento, which are something over a degree
south of this line, all of these places are either on it or
within less than a degree of it, north or south.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>You will see, as drawn on the chart, how the sun’s rays
morning and evening, summer and winter, are indicated
streaming out in the direction of the latitude arrows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
marked 40°. If you live on or near any of the other degrees
of latitude, indicated by the other arrows, imagine
the center of the sun slipped up or down to that point,
and then trace the rays lightly with a soft pencil across
the chart in lines parallel with the respective arrows.</p>

</div>

<p>Of course, if you make any change, all four suns must
be moved in a corresponding way, for you will observe
how beautifully symmetrical the chart is. For any
given northern latitude, the midsummer sun rises and
sets <em>north</em> of due east and west at exactly corresponding
points on the eastern and western horizons, and these
points in turn exactly correspond, six months later,
with those for midwinter day <em>south</em> of due east and west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>And this exact correspondence east and west, for the
day, and north and south, for the season, will obtain
for any day in the year, or for any place you take on
the earth’s surface. Of course, it must be noted that
the time of rising and setting will change with every
new position taken. If you draw the midsummer sun
down and the midwinter sun correspondingly up until
they coalesce at “E” and “W,” you have the equinoxes
about March 21st and September 21st, with the sun
rising and setting due east and west, and equal day
and night in any part of the world except the poles.</p>

</div>

<p>Living where you do, somewhere between 30° and 50°
north latitude, the sun, summer or winter, will never
pass overhead at noon but shine on a slant from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
south, very much more in winter than summer. This
slant of the sun, however, will not concern you practically
so much in placing your house, as will the time
and direction of sunrise at the extremes of June and
December, and the position of the sun the successive
hours of the day, at those times of the year.</p>

<p>You have certain rooms in which you especially want
the sun, morning or afternoon; or a porch you want as
much in the shade as possible, let us say. In tracing
the direction of the sun’s rays, do not think of them as
converging or as spreading out. Think of them rather
as coming in great, broad, parallel bands so that no
matter how large your house may be, the moment one
side gets the sun, the opposite parallel side falls into
shade. The broad band of parallel lines streaming
from the sun, as seen on the chart, is meant to illustrate
this.</p>

<p>Now cut a piece of light cardboard in the shape of your
house, at a greatly reduced scale, with all its porches
and projections, as, for example, the blank form on the
chart. Attach it with a pin at the center of the chart,
so it may be easily turned. First place your house
facing directly east. You will see on midsummer day
that the north and east elevations will get the first
morning sun. About 8 o’clock the sun will leave the
north side and begin to illuminate the south elevation.
At noon, the sun will pass from the east to the west
side of the house, and then, at 4 o’clock, leave the south
and creep back to the north side of the house, shining
on west and north sides from then on until its setting
between 7 and 8 o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_012">
  <img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">

  </div>
</div>

<p>At the opposite season of the year, that is, in midwinter,
your house, still faced directly east, will have the first
sun between 7 and 8 o’clock in the morning on the east
and south sides. At noon, the east side will be deserted
for the west, and from then on the south and west
sides of the house will have the sun until its setting
between 4 and 5 o’clock. Thus, in the winter, the north
side of your house will get no sun at all. This would
hardly be a good place for the kitchen, though it would
be well enough in the summer, as the sun would be out
of it by 8 o’clock in the morning and not return until
4 o’clock in the afternoon when its rays are shorn of
much of their midday strength. You know, of course,
that during the changing seasons or the changing hours
of the day, the sun’s warmth depends largely on the
slant of its rays. In the summer, the north side would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
be a good place for a shady porch most of the day.
However, the east side of the house would give you a
shady porch from noon till sunset. But a porch around
the northeast corner would give you shade from 8 o’clock
in the morning clear through the day until sunset.</p>

<p>By turning your house one way or another from this
direct east and west position, you can see what modifications
of sun and shade you get. Suppose you turn it
northeast, almost facing the morning sun on midsummer
day. The front of the house would directly get the rising
sun between 4 and 5 o’clock in the morning. At 6
o’clock, the south front would come into the sunlight.
At half-past 10 o’clock, the east front would fall into
shade for the rest of the day, while the west front would
begin to catch the sun. By 2:30 o’clock in the afternoon,
the south side would be in the shade for the rest of the
day and the north side would get the sun from then
on till sunset, between 7 and 8 o’clock. A porch on the
east front of this house would be in the shade all the
summer day after half-past 10 o’clock. But, in the
winter, it would not be so fortunate as the house
faced to the cardinal points, for, as just indicated, it
would get the sun only on two sides all day long;
and yet the summer advantages might more than compensate.
Try slighter turns than those suggested, and
you may get just the result you want for a given room
or porch.</p>

<p>The placing of your house for the sun is really a problem
of settling on the rooms or porches you want favored,
and then letting the other portions of the house take care
of themselves. In determining these questions of sun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
and shade on your house, due consideration must be
given to neighboring structures, trees, or portions of
the house that might otherwise get the sun if it were
not for certain extensions, such as bays, porches, L’s,
and the like. Of course, nearby hills or mountains
would have a marked effect on just when you got the
sun in the morning or lose it in the evening, no matter
where or when the sun really rose and set.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>As already suggested, if you live on or near any of the
other degrees of north latitude marked, imagine the
center of the suns slipped around to that degree, and
then draw light pencil lines across the chart parallel
with the respective arrows. Do the same also for other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
parts of the year than the solstices which are shown
here. For each succeeding month, move the center of
the suns down and up from the solsticial points about a
third of the distance to “E.” At “E” the sun has
reached either equinox and will rise directly in the east
and set directly in the west. Remember that for several
days on either side of a given position of the sun, there
will be no essential change in the direction of its rays
that you need practically to consider.</p>

<p>But at the times, other than the solstices, while you
can thus get the direction of the rising and setting sun,
the sun-dial of our chart won’t exactly apply. What
happens is that as the sun moves down or up from the
solstice to the equinox, the summer hour spaces grow
more uniform, while the winter hours grow somewhat
longer. But with the general direction of the morning
and afternoon light settled for the two solsticial extremes,
the hour position of the sun during the between
seasons will not be of so much importance.</p>

<p>Of course, you can’t have everything in this world
exactly your own way, but by studying carefully the
Orientation Chart in connection with your plans for
building a home, you may get many valuable hints for
selecting your lot and locating your house which will
lead to arrangement of lasting satisfaction to you in
the coziness, comfort, and attractiveness of your home.
A sunny corner or a shady spot, where you need it and
when you need it, may cure an invalid or develop a
poet, as the case may be and as the years go on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The Right Kind of House to Orient</i></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Before you have the problem of orienting your home,
you have the more important problem of deciding on
the kind of home you intend to build. It is one of the
most, if not the most, important question you have to
settle.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is an economic question, for you want
to be sure of getting value received for the money you
expend. To do so, the house you build must, aside from
its satisfactory design, be permanent; it must be easily
and economically maintained; it must be comfortable and
safe against fire; and it must be attractive. In a word, it
must give you satisfaction in every way, inasmuch as you
and your family are going to be in it a long time; or, if
circumstances compel you to move, you want the house
to make a persuasively attractive appeal to the intending
renter or purchaser.</p>

<p>Such a house you can build of brick, the endurance of
which has been demonstrated through thousands of years.
“By frost, nor fire, nor flood, nor even time are well
burned clays destroyed.” This permanence of brick construction
means a saving on insurance rates, on upkeep,
and on depreciation, while the material lends itself to the
most beautiful and varied artistic effects. “Strength and
beauty,” the essential characteristics of all good building,
may be fully met in brick construction.</p>

<p>If you have not already seen <cite>The Story of Brick</cite>, you
should send for a copy, as you will find in it many valuable
suggestions.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
